# at the hardcoded path `.github/workflows/release_prep.sh`.
#
# Args:
#   $1: tag name (e.g. 0.1.0). Must match VERSION in version.bzl.
#
# Side effects:
#   Writes rules_venv-${TAG}.tar.gz to the current directory. This
#   filename must match the `release_files` glob in release.yaml.
#
# Output:
#   Release notes to stdout. The release_ruleset workflow redirects
#   stdout into release_notes.txt for the GitHub release body. All
#   other noise (tar, sed, version checks) goes to stderr.
